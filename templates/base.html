    <p>Welcome to Branch! My name is Daniel Hilla. I am the creator of Branch.

    So what is Branch? Branch is a Choose Your Own Adventure game. You start off at the "seed." Then you enter what you want to do next. Click "Do it!" and you will move to the next Branch of your adventure. It is pretty simple. Every Branch of your adventure is written by other users like you. If at any point along your adventure, you want to do something that hasn't been done before, you will be able to write it yourself! That's all you need to know to get started. If you want to get deeper into Branch, click "Learn more." If you want to get going on your adventure, click "Start."</p>

      Branch is primarily user created, user moderated, and user perpetuated. Some of Branch's "Branches" may contain content that is poorly written, grammatically incorrect, strange, offensive, obscene, or even unsuitable for people under the age of 18. Proceed with caution and discretion.</p>
